Module 6 python-api Challenge. In this repositry I have uploaded a folder called Python-api-challenge, within this folder there is a folder called WeatherPy which contains all the randomly generated data and analysis. In the WeatherPy folder there are the solved api-project Vacation_Py and WeatherPy files. The output_data file contains the exported cities.csv file from the WeatherPy pandas file as well as all the graphs created in the WeatherPy file.The pandas codes are annotated for ease of reading and understanding. To create the code I adapted code from class activities and lectures.
